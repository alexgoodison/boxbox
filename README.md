🏎️ Boxbox - F1 Race Visualiser & Overtake Prediction Model

## 📌 Project Overview (In Progress)
This project aims to build a visualiser for F1 raches and machine learning model to predict whether an overtake attempt in a Formula 1 race will be **successful or not**. This will be based on various race, car, and track parameters. The model uses historical F1 race data, including telemetry, driver stats, and environmental factors, to make real-time predictions.
